// i am starting a lecture related to blockchain learning by building my own blockchain using javascript
// in this course we'll create a fully functional blockchain from scratch using the javascript programming language. 

// we are going to be building out a blockchain that has all the same functionality that you'll find in a production level blockchain in real life like Bitcoin and ethreum.

our blockchain will be able
1- to perform a proof of work to secure the blockchain
2- Create new Blocks through a mining Process
3- Create new, immutable transactions
4- Validate the blockchain and all block data.
5- Retreive address/transaction/block data
    .... and many other important features as well.

in this course we'll also build out a decentralized blockchain network that will host an entire blockchain.

the first step in creating our blockchain network is that 
1- we'll build out an API or a server to interact with our blockchain from the internet.
2- from where we'll upgrade our API to a decentralized blockchain network, to host our blockchain
    (we'll upgrade our API so that it consists of multiple different nodes allowing us to create a decentralized network)
3- we'll also create a consensus algorithm to make sure that our data to the entire decentralized network is legitimate and always synchronized
4- and finally we'll create a block explorer web page so that we can explore the data by using a graphical interface. 

the best thing is that all of this will be done on my own computer or laptop. 

Prerequisites
1- computer
2- Basic knowledge of JS programming

////////////////////////////////////////////////
Purpose of this Course?
to help you understand how blockchain technology actually works by building you own blockchain and decentralized network. 

////// WHat you will accomplish?
by the end of this course you will have a full fledge blockchain prototype, that is hosted on the decentralized blockchain network. and you will have gain a great deal of knowledge and understanding is that how blockchain is actually works under the hood.
