1- Gain deep understanding of blockchain technology by building out you own blockchain from scratch.
2- we'll breakdown blockchain, step by step, to understand the code behined them.
3- Understand how a decentralized blockchain network functions by building out your own.


////////////// Course Layout////////////////
1- Build Blockchain data structure
    that have the ability and proof of work 
    a- mine new blocks
    b- create transactions
    c- validate the chain
    d- retreive address data
    e- and other functionality
2- Build blockchain API / Server
    through our API we'll be able to use all of the functionality that we have build in our blockchain data structure
3- build decentralized blockchain network.
    which means that we'll have multiple servers running and  acting as saperate nodes. 
    and we'll make sure that all of the node interact with  each other properly and shared data with each other with correct format. we'll synchronize the entire network by making sure that any new blocks or transactions that are created or bloadcast through out the entire network 
4- we'll build network consensus algorithm. 
    consensus algorithm is used to make sure that our entire blockchain stays synchronise. and it is used to make sure that each node in our network has the correct blockchain data. 
5- we'll create a block explorer. 
    our block explorer will be a user interface that allow us to explore our blockchain in user friendly manner. 
    and that will allow us to querry our blockchain for specific blocks, transactions, and addresses. 

at the end of this course we'll a fully functional prototype and we'll have a strong understanding how blockchain technology actually workd under the hood.
